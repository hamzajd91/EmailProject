          <h2 className="mb-3">What is Business Intelligence Consulting?</h2>
          <p>
            Business Intelligence, Data Warehouse, Business Warehouse, Data Analytics, Business Analytics are referring
            to a set of techniques and tools for the acquisition and transformation of raw data into meaningful and
            useful information for business analysis purposes.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Business intelligence (BI)</b> comprises the strategies and technologies used by enterprises for the data
            analysis of business information. BI technologies provide historical, current, and predictive views
            of business operations. Common functions of business intelligence technologies include reporting, online
            analytical processing, analytics, data mining, process mining, complex event processing, business
            performance management, benchmarking, text mining, predictive analytics, and prescriptive analytics. BI
            technologies can handle large amounts of structured and sometimes unstructured data to help identify,
            develop, and otherwise create new strategic business opportunities. They aim to allow for the easy
            interpretation of these big data. Identifying new opportunities and implementing an effective strategy based
            on insights can provide businesses with a competitive market advantage and long-term stability.
          </p>
          <p>
            Business intelligence can be used by enterprises to support a wide range of business decisions ranging from
            operational to strategic. Basic operating decisions include product positioning or pricing. Strategic
            business decisions involve priorities, goals, and directions at the broadest level. In all cases, BI is most
            effective when it combines data derived from the market in which a company operates (external data) with
            data from company sources internal to the business such as financial and operations data (internal data).
            When combined, external and internal data can provide a complete picture which, in effect, creates an
            "intelligence" that cannot be derived from any singular set of data. Amongst myriad uses, business
            intelligence tools empower organizations to gain insight into new markets, to assess demand and suitability
            of products and services for different market segments, and to gauge the impact of marketing efforts.
          </p>
          <p>
            BI applications use data gathered from a data warehouse (DW) or from a data mart, and the concepts of BI and
            DW combine as "BI/DW" or as "BIDW". A data warehouse contains a copy of analytical data that
            facilitate decision support.
