          <h2 className="mb-3">Hiring the Best Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Consulting Company.</h2>
          <p>
            CRM is a customer-centric approach to manage a company’s interaction with current and potential customers.
            In practice, CRM is being used in the following settings:
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Call Center:</b> A call center is a centralized department to which phone calls from current and
            potential customers are directed. Call centers can handle inbound and/or outbound calls, and be located
            either within a company or outsourced to another company that specializes in handling calls.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Contact Center Automation or Computer Telephony Integration (CTI):</b> is designed to reduce the
            repetitive and tedious parts of a contact center agent's job. In other cases, it's being used to segment
            customer groups based on a few predesigned questions, so the contact center agent who specializes in the
            fields can serve their customers more effectively.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Social Media:</b> involves the use of social media and technology to engage and learn from consumers.
            Some CRM systems integrate social media sites like Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook to track, influence, and
            communicate with customers.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Location-based services:</b> technologies that create geographic marketing campaigns. The systems take in
            information based on a customer's physical location and sometimes integrates it with
            popular location-based GPS applications. It can be used for networking or contact management as well to help
            increase sales based on location.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Business-to-Consumer (B2C) and Business-to-Business Transactions:</b> it can be applied to B2B & B2C. The
            main differences between B2C and B2B of CRM systems concern aspects like the sizing of contact databases and
            the length of relationships.[53] B2B companies tend to have smaller contact databases than B2C because the
            volume of sales in B2B is relatively small.  B2B also tends to have different and older payment processing
            methods than B2C. For example, B2B still requires an invoice and PO for approval.
          </p>
          <p>
            The four largest brands of stand-alone or integrated CRM system offerings are: SAP, Oracle, Salesforce, and
            Microsoft Dynamics.

          <h3>Tips on Hiring the Best Customer Relationship Management Consulting Company</h3>
          <p>
            You were tasked to run a CRM project for your company and don’t know where to start. Don’t worry. After
            understanding the basics of CRM, below are some tips for finding the right CRM consulting company on
            Hindsyght.
          </p>
          <h5 className="proficiency_step">
            Step 1: Compose a well-defined brief of what your business is trying to solve or accommodate
          </h5>
          <p>
            The most crucial first step is to identify business needs to ensure your project and its deliverable will
            address those requirements. It can be to solve a persistent, ongoing issue or to create new functionalities
            to combat the competition.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before diving into the software brands, you need to understand your project objectives and scopes. Once
            knowing what you are going to build, take a good look at your Information System landscape. If it’s
            possible, the most advisable is to choose the brand that you already have in-house. Many CTOs prefer
            best-of-breed; however, the headache of the interface and the effort of troubleshooting when it comes to
            production environment broken down outweigh the functionalities that the best-of-breed has to offer.
            Moreover, the resources and skill set that require to support two different systems will be costly and hard
            to find. For example, if your core ERP is the SAP system, it’s best to alter your scopes to SAP CRM
            solutions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, the cost of your project will depend on your scope of work, and the specific skills needed to bring
            your project to life. Make sure to spell out the scopes and the skill sets required to complete the job.
