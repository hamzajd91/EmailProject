We don’t take sides when it comes to factual disputes, so we expect you to stand behind your statements.</p></li><li><p>Your reviews should be relevant and appropriate. Reviews should not be about matters that don't address the core customer experience.  We encourage you to think about your experience from a few perspectives and include both a pro and a con to provide a balanced review.</p></li><li><p>We want to hear about your firsthand experience, not what you heard from others. Tell your story without broad generalizations and allegations.</p></li><li><p>Your review should be factually correct. Feel free to provide your opinions, but don't exaggerate or misrepresent your experience. We don't take sides when it comes to factual disputes, so we expect you to stand behind your review.</p></li><li><p>Review updates should reflect a new experience or interaction with the business.
