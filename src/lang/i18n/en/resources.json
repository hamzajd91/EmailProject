      "title": "Top Strategies for Hiring the Right IT Firm",
      "body": "<p>As any company scales, finding the right IT consulting firm is vital for a smooth and optimized IT landscape. But given the high failure rate of large-scale IT projects, choosing a firm can also be a risky endeavor. According to a 2017 <a href='https://www.pmi.org/-/media/pmi/documents/public/pdf/learning/thought-leadership/pulse/pulse-of-the-profession-2017.pdf?sc_lang_temp=en'>report</a> from the Project Management Institute (PMI), 14% of all IT projects fail. In addition, of the projects that didn’t fail, 31% didn’t meet their goals, 43% exceeded their initial budgets, and 49% were late. These statistics don’t even account for projects that were completed on time and within budget, but produced deliverables that were unusable or that didn’t meet expectations. To help you maximize your chances of success on future IT projects, we put together the top things you should consider when hiring an IT firm.</p><h3>Small firms with big reputations</h3><p>Big consulting firms are well-known and reputable for a reason, but they may not be the best solution for small to medium businesses. Aside from being more affordable, smaller consulting firms may be more sympathetic to your business challenges than larger, more prestigious firms. When hiring an IT consulting firm, instead of focusing on brand or size, find out how satisfied clients similar to your business needs have been with their work. For example, you might want to dig deeper to find out answers to the following:</p><ul><li>Was the client satisfied with the quality of the services based on the money they spent?</li><li>Did the firm exercise the knowledge, specialization, or skill sets the client was looking for?</li><li>Did the firm deliver a solution that aligned with the business requirements and project scope?</li></ul><h3>A proven track record of project management</h3><p>While this may seem like a no-brainer, good project management can be hard to come by. A good project manager will be able to work with all stakeholders and end users to drive the project forward on time and within budget. In addition to making sure the project and expectations are clearly defined, they'll also ensure that what gets implemented actually make senses. While most consulting firms can easily claim to master project management, you may find client testimonials or other forms of direct feedback to be more trustworthy and reliable.</p><h3>Communication throughout the project lifecycle</h3><p>Too often in IT implementation projects, the people who are directly affected by the change don’t have the opportunity to provide their input until it’s too late. A good consulting firm will keep all lines of communication open throughout the project lifecycle in order to properly manage everyone’s expectations. They will communicate the right information in a timely manner so that the end result isn’t a surprise to anyone. When the appropriate team members have the opportunity to give their input at critical moments, it will limit the possibility of delaying the project to fix any issues that may come at the end.</p><h3>Prepares you for change management</h3><p>A good consulting firm will make sure all stakeholders are on the same page and work with everyone to shape what’s going to change. As a business owner, you might be leading the change, but employees who will be experiencing the change firsthand should feel like they had the opportunity to participate. For example, the right consulting firm will be able to tell you who should participate on the front and back end, making sure that every department is prepared and accepts the new system when it’s in place. These changes could include major updates to normal business processes and/or documentation, and you’ll want employee buy-in when it happens.</p><p>Knowing what to look for in an IT firm can lead to successful implementation and reassurance that it will happen. Instead of limiting your consulting options to brand names, budget, or word-of-mouth, there are other important factors you should consider, like a proven track record of project management, communication, and change management. Industry reviews can provide more confidence in the next firm you hire for an IT implementation project, as well as create more transparency in the field as a whole.</p>",

It's an antiquated process that wastes a lot of time & resources.</p><p>What can companies do to support their sales team better and to ensure that they can use their resources effectively? If you want to improve the effectiveness of your sales team, here are four recommendations that can help you increase sales:</p><h4>Consider a new method to improve awareness</h4><p>It is essential to be innovative when it comes to acquiring new customers. You can improve the quality of your leads by maintaining a storefront on Hindsyght. As a platform that connects IT services firms with small and medium-sized companies, it captures the right target audience. Having a storefront there means you become more visible to the right people. Your sales team will be able to chase the right prospects instead of wasting time verifying leads from other sources.</p><p>If you have the base or plus subscription on Hindsyght, you get complete visibility of who is looking at your profile. The sales pitch can be tailored and targeted to fit each lead and their industry. It gives you a higher chance of closing the deal because your services will provide exactly what the clients are looking for.</p><h4>Arm your sales team with mobile and collaboration tools</h4><p>Salespeople can spend a large chunk of their day out in the field, so firms need to give them access to critical customer information through their mobile phones. It can come in the form of an app or a mobile CRM solution - whichever works for your company.</p><h4>Offer training opportunities where they can learn about best practices</h4><p>From technical training on the products and services you offer to sales process training, investing in your staff can help your team become more productive. It is crucial for your salespeople to understand your IT products and services from the inside out. It's the only way they will be able to pitch for your firm with confidence.</p><h4>Minimize time spent on administrative tasks</h4><p>Most sales roles have administrative components, such as data entry and customer service. It might be impossible to eradicate these tasks, but your firm should ensure that these activities do not take up more time than selling activities. Minimizing the amount of non-sales activities that your sales team needs to do frees up their time to do what they do best - closing the deal and serving your clients.</p><p>By following the strategy above, you can significantly increase the effectiveness of your sales team. So sign up to Hindsyght today to get access to high-quality leads that are looking for an IT firm just like yours.</p>",

The short answer: a fresh set of eyes and relevant experience that will reduce the risk of project failure and save you money. </p><p>Top talent in the IT industry is scarce. If you need an IT services professional with skills in a highly specialized area, it makes sense to hire someone who has been around the block. Their experience working with different companies means that they have encountered similar issues that you’re facing and can hit the ground running.</p><p>Here are additional benefits to hiring an IT consulting firm for your business:</p><h4>They get the job done without you having to hire another headcount</h4><p>One of the main benefits of hiring IT consulting firms is that they can get projects off the ground and complete those projects without your business having to hire additional headcounts. Most small and medium-sized businesses often do not have the budget to hire an employee with a specialized IT background full-time. The IT consultant can finish the project, and the business has no obligation to keep them on after that.</p><h4>They can identify potential roadblocks</h4><p>You need someone who can identify potential roadblocks before the start of any IT project. This ability usually comes with experience - someone who has been there and done that. They have most likely seen the same problem that you’re having multiple times in their previous engagements. They can then use that experience to provide a better roadmap for your project.</p><h4>They offer a different perspective</h4><p>Internal teams often have limited exposure to different ways of doing things. On the other hand, consultants can often approach IT problems from a fresh angle, often coming up with creative ways to solve existing issues or using their past experience to guide your business forward. <a href='https://www.hindsyght.com/' target='_blank'>IT services</a> consultants can act as an unbiased third-party with your project’s success as their only goal.</p><h4>They provide flexibility</h4><p>IT consultants can fill in the gaps that exist in most small and medium-sized businesses. They fix existing and difficult IT issues. Since they are hired to fix a specific problem within a set timeframe, they offer a flexible and cost-effective solution to your business.</p><h4>They accelerate internal skills</h4><p>The complexity involved in new IT projects can often exceed the abilities of your staff. Hiring consultants can fill in the gaps while providing your employees with the training they need to take the project forward. IT consultants do typically have great expertise in your industry. The internal team can refer to their experience for support as they get used to the new systems.</p><p>The value of hiring professional IT consultants goes beyond cost-reduction and fresh thinking. The new technologies that they introduce and the training that they provide to existing employees mean that your business will benefit over the long term from their skills.</p><p>Hiring an IT consultant benefits most small and medium-sized businesses that want their IT systems to improve productivity.</p><p>Do you run an IT services firm and are looking for new clients?</p><p>Claim your storefront at Hindsyght. We connect IT services businesses like yours with thousands of small and medium-sized businesses who are looking for just the kind of services you offer.</p><p>We understand that each project requires a highly specialized set of skills, so our platform makes it easy for businesses to find the right IT services provider - whether they are looking for a web developer, an SAP consultant, or improved cybersecurity. Hindsyght reaches all corners of the country, so sign-up and claim your storefront today.</p>",

      "title": "Top 3 things you shouldn't forget in an IT consulting contract",
      "body": "<p>Most IT consulting contracts typically include the scope of the service, high-level timeline, cost, payment terms, and general terms and conditions (T&Cs). However, including additional aspects into the contract can help prevent headaches down the time through the project lifecycle.</p><h4>Potential Issue #1 </h4><p>I'm sure you have heard of the term \"out of scope\" when working with consulting companies. Most consultants are trained to examine changes and are extremely careful to agree with making those changes on their dime. Therefore, they may often say the changes are out of scope, or that they need to assess it to determine if it is in scope or out of scope. This is especially important on a fixed fee contract. But on a contract with a cap, this is also very important. </p><h4>Potential Issue #2</h4><p>What about dealing with a lousy IT consultant?  No matter how good a consulting firm is, there are always instances where a couple of the consultants on the project are below par. There is no way that any company can guarantee that all its resources can provide excellent service. When you get to that situation, can you easily replace those consultants? </p><h4>Potential Issue #3</h4><p>What about travel costs?  Do you see the fee for travel and think to yourself, they expensed first-class ticket and $100 dinner?  Let's eliminate some of these potential issues before they even start. </p><p>So outside of the typical items you put on the contract, let's make sure you add the following language too (Note: the consulting company will negotiate these terms, so pick and choose what is more important to you and come to a middle ground with them). </p><p><strong>Essence of the requirements </strong> - Add a condition about using a reasonable person standard to address the essence of the requirements in the contract. Not every little change is a change request. Most consultants are trained to manage the scope tightly. Often, every small change is considered a change request. You can lose sight of what the essence of the requirements is. For example, your consultant might have built something that he/she interpreted inaccurately. If you need him to make changes to correct his misinterpretation, that should not be a change request. </p><p><strong>Replacement of resources </strong> - Put a clause similar to this on the contract:  \"Management, supervisory, or technical personnel committed to the Work performed under this Agreement shall not be removed or reassigned for the duration of the Work for a given Statement(s) of Work without prior notice to Client. The Client has the right to cause to reject specific personnel for any Work performed under this Agreement. The consultant shall provide the Client with an agreed-upon transition phase of at least one week for every one (1) month of service for each occurrence at no cost to the Client.  If more than ten (10) percent of the Key Personnel are transitioned from a Statement of Work, Client will have the right to terminate the associated Statement of Work and this Agreement.\"  The consulting firm will negotiate this, but this puts accountability on them to find the right resources to put on your project. </p><p><strong>Travel Expenses </strong> - Make sure you add a clause regarding the travel expenses.  If your company has an excellent travel policy, make sure they adhere to your travel policy.  If you don't have one, set the expectations for what expenses are allowable and what is not. This way, you won't be surprised when you get the bill. </p><p>A tight contract will prove to be important for you when you hire an IT services firm. It provides a framework for the consulting firm, so their expectations are set early on. It also shows them that you are serious about the execution of the project and that you will stay engaged. This will help improve the partnership between you and the consulting firm.</p>",

      "title": "How to effectively manage IT consulting firms to optimize your project results",
      "body": "<p>What if I say hiring IT consulting firms will only be as successful as the amount of work you put in and the leadership you provide? Would you still want to hire outside help? Isn’t the point of hiring an IT consulting firm to reduce the amount of work you have to do? Well, let me explain. </p><p>Most companies bring in reputable IT consulting firms to assist with complex projects. But you’ve probably heard of horror stories about ERP implementation projects that took years to complete, and after millions of dollars spent, the company decided to scrap it. What about implementations that are half-baked but are moved to production anyway, because the company can no longer afford to fix all the issues. They end up with a system that nobody likes but have no choice but to use. </p><p>The root cause is you let the consultants drive the project and did not provide adequate management and support during the process. While most consulting firms come in with industry expertise and have considerable technical knowhow, they are not an expert in your processes, nor do they understand your company culture. Without adequate guidance, they will drive the project toward what they think is correct rather than what the company actually needs. </p><p>Whether it is lack of collaboration, lack of business support, or lack of leadership participation, the result typically will be a system that doesn’t match the company’s expectations. </p><p><strong>Here are a few things that you can do differently to ensure project success. </strong><ol><li><p><strong>Understands the requirements and what success really means upfront </strong>–  It starts from the beginning. Put together a set of requirements that is thorough enough for your RFP process. You also need to understand what success means, and this should be communicated to the IT firms. As you go through the proposal with them, make sure that they fully understand the needs of your company (this means that they pay attention). Selecting the right IT vendor is a significant first step toward a successful outcome. </p></li><li><p><strong>Get a tight contract in place </strong>– Once you have selected a firm, putting the right contract in place can help eliminate some of the headaches that may come over the course of the project lifecycle. Outside of price, scope and the terms & conditions, you also need to include other aspects such as performance, resource replacement, and travel. For example, I always put a statement that talks about the essence of the requirements in my contracts because this deals with questions that may arise about whether particular requirements are in scope or out of scope. The two parties shall review the essence of the requirements using a “reasonable person standard” to determine if it should be in scope or out of scope. I also include conditions surrounding the replacement of resources. When working with consulting firms, there are instances where their IT consultant may leave or may not be performing up to your standard. The language should include a statement that you can replace any consultant that are not performing at any time. It should also include a 2-week knowledge transfer period where you don’t have to pay for the services during the transition period. Lastly, you should put a cap on the expenses and make sure that they adhere to your company’s travel policy. </p></li><li><p><strong>Planning </strong>– When the consulting firm share their project plan, take the time to review and understand it. Meet with them to make sure everyone knows what each of the critical activities are. One example I can share is during one of my ERP implementations, we discussed the details in the plan for Blueprinting. I asked for clarification on some key activities, thinking that a demo of the ERP solution will be part of the blueprint. The consulting firm stated that they plan to show the process flows in PowerPoint. We felt that the PowerPoint presentation  wouldn’t have the benefits as an actual demo. We revised the plan and it was beneficial. Most users are confused with process flow charts so having something to visualize is exceptionally useful in our case. The point is, understand the plan, and make changes to it to make sure things you want to be done are included. </p></li><li><p><strong>Project Execution </strong>– Participate and provide the support to the consulting firm. Help them drive critical decisions and provide the business participation needed. It is also important for you to clear roadblocks because these consultants don’t know your internal politics. If you notice that your existing consultants don’t live up to your expectations during the execution phase, replace them as soon as possible. The longer you wait, the more issues down the road you need to resolve. Helping direct the path of the project throughout the execution stage will help increase the chance of success. </p></li><li><p><strong>Organizational Change Management </strong>– OCM is often overlooked, but it is one of the most crucial aspects of any complex project. The consulting firm you hire should have strong OCM support. It is more than just training and communications. It should also identify how changes will affect the organization. They then need to map out how the organization should handle these changes while making sure that those impacted feel comfortable and understand the new process. Dealing with change is extremely difficult, so ask and make sure your OCM leads know what he/she is talking about and have a solid plan of action in their hands. </p></li><li><p><strong>Communications and Project Governance </strong>– Lastly, engage in the governance and communications process. The consulting firm should work with you to over-communicate because it is challenging to get everyone on the same page when change is implemented. Over communicating and then follow up with key stakeholders in the company may be required to keep everyone on board. You also need to make sure that proper processes are in place from a governance perspective. Utilize the steering committee to make critical decisions and then document and communicate the decisions made to all parties. If you are implementing a SOX controlled system, the type of documentation you need for future audits should be identified. The consulting firms must work with you to adhere to the governance process you want to have in place. </p></li></ol><p>Working with an IT consulting firm is an integral part of most organizations. How well they work for you is based on how much work you put into the relationship. Follow these guidelines, and you will see how effective your partnership with consulting firms can be. </p>",

      "body": "<h3>Case Study:</h3><p>St. Jude Medical (SJM), a global medical devices company based in Minneapolis, was being bogged down each month for more than 30 hours because of the need to produce the company’s Inventory Stock Quantity and Valuation report. The process of getting this report was an embarrassment to the SJM IT Director, who have already tried different approaches to resolve the issue. </p><p>The SJM IT Director has listened to the suggestions of both his internal staff and implementation vendor. However, every approach they’ve tried didn’t solve the issue, so the director decided to look for a consulting company that specializes in SAP Data Warehouse through word-of-mouth. He found Summerlin Analytics. </p><p>The process of finding IT companies that specializes in your systems can be long and daunting. Here’s where Hindsyght comes in. Hindsyght connects the IT directors and other decision-makers with companies like Summerlin Analytics. Our platform makes these kinds of connections easier to establish, so you won’t need to rely solely on your business connections to find the right IT consulting firm. </p><p>Read this case study on how Summerlin Analytics tackled the challenges at SJM.  </p><h4>The Challenge</h4><p>Before Summerlin Analytics came in, just generating the Inventory Stock Quantity and Valuation report for SJM required a 15-hour downtime of the reporting systems at month-end. Yet, more often than not, the report will show an incorrect inventory valuation of $0.00. This is a business that has an annual revenue of $5.6 billion (2014). </p><p>A temporary solution was initially recommended. A complete “drop-and-reload” of the data can be done to get the report. However, this required an additional 15 hours of downtime. When you combine the number of hours that are involved in research and meetings to prepare for the downtime, it is taking the company more than 30 hours each month just to get this report. Clearly, something needs to be done. </p><h4>Prior Approaches </h4><p>Two generally accepted solutions have already been implemented at SJM, to little effect. These approaches are: </p><ul><li>Drop and reload</li></ul><p>This was a solution that relied on building “snapshots” of inventory quantities and unit prices. The issue arises when unit prices for the next month are not yet set because it uses $0.00 as the unit price. </p><ul><li>Using the prior month’s valuation </li></ul><p>The company’s preferred vendor suggested this. It uses “snapshots” from the previous month. <strong> While it reduces the downtime, it doesn’t address the cause of the issue, which is $0.00 for the value of the inventory.   </strong></p><h4>Hiring an IT Consulting Firm </h4><p>The internal team doesn’t have the depth of knowledge to resolve the issue, while suggestions from his implementation vendor were more like a series of breaks/fixes that don’t solve the underlying problems. The SJM IT Director bought in Hau from Summerlin Analytics to dig deeper into the process. </p><p>Summerlin Analytics discovered an external process where the company performed a monthly evaluation of their materials. This happens towards the end of every month. Crucially, the material valuation process had to be completed before the inventory valuation could begin. When this dependency was overlooked, it resulted in a report with $0.00 as the inventory stock value. </p><h4>The Recommended Solution </h4><p>Summerlin Analytics is a consulting firm that specializes in SAP Analytics and Data Warehousing. They understand the difference between the snapshot and non-cumulative inventory models. SJM previously only used the snapshot approach, which didn’t work for the business. The noncumulative approach offers a better solution. </p><p>The concept of noncumulative approach is challenging for most employees and contractors. It uses delta-pointers to dynamically calculate inventory quantities and valuation. With the help of Summerlin Analytics, the company was able to generate the report they needed with minimal downtime. </p><h4>Implementation and Results </h4><p>The finance analyst at SJM confirmed that only an approximate valuation was needed to complete the month’s books because the prices did not fluctuate significantly from month to month. During the testing phase, the interim solution allowed the finance analyst to receive the report within an hour. </p><p>For a more permanent solution, Summerlin Analytics suggested implementing the “Best Practice.” This method required three months to migrate existing reports to a more stable process and data model. </p><p>After much regression testing, the director was finally relieved from long-standing pain. The new process required zero downtime of the reporting systems (during month-end or at any other time).</p><p>In summary, the permanent solution resulted in:</p><ul><li>Elimination of the 15-hour load requirement (saving the company up to an additional 180 hours of downtime per year).</li><li>Elimination of further downtime due to “drop and reload” operations (saving the company up to a further 180 hours per year).</li><li>The IT Director no longer had to apologize for this issue to his colleagues every month</li><li>Elimination of wasted time spent by internal staff and vendors trying to solve this recurring issue</li></ul><p>(We estimate the cost savings to be approximately $54,000 USD or 30 hours/month * 12 months * $150/hour. This does not include the time required for issue identification, solution proposals, status meetings, or communication.)</p><p>Aside from preserving the reputation of the SJM IT Director and his team, the permanent solution, as proposed and implemented by Summerlin Analytics, allowed them to put this issue to rest and refocus on delivering value across the business.</p><p>The team at Summerlin Analytics went on to win more work from SJM and were asked to lead their European data warehouse project. </p><h4>Conclusion</h4><ul><li>Large consulting agencies often compartmentalize their resources, limiting their experience. As a result, a resource may offer a technical yet myopic solution through no fault of his own</li><li>A smaller team like Summerlin Analytics, which focuses primarily on supply chain reporting have a broader understanding of business tools. Their size requires them to wear many hats (business analyst, developer, and project manager)</li><li>A common challenge is that large companies are often busy solving their own business problems and do not have the time or resources to cultivate a network of experienced IT professionals </li><li>Similarly, a small but highly experienced team like Summerlin Analytics are highly engaged with project delivery but do not have the bandwidth to promote their expertise. </li><li>Hindsyght is the platform that connects these two groups which can then mutually benefit from their business relationship </li></ul><p>IT challenges in business can be solved quickly and cost-effectively with the help of consulting firms that specializes in functional proficiencies. </p><p>Hindsyght has a comprehensive list of IT consulting firms that specialize in ERP systems, CRM systems, mobile app development, and cybersecurity, among many others.

      "body": "<h3>Increase network capacity for more remote users</h3><p>COVID-19 has created an increase in demand for remote access. Suddenly, employees are being asked to work remotely. The demand for VPN connection can increase to 500% or more.</p><p>Most small to mid-size companies may not have the infrastructure and tools to support this demand, unless they are entirely on the cloud using SAAS based applications. </p><p>For most of the companies that still have business applications hosted inhouse and have network share drives, this increase in demand can be crippling. Here are some simple ways to quickly enhance your infrastructure and get your employees to be as productive as they can be.</p><h3>Internet vs. VPN bandwidth</h3><p>Your demand for both the Internet and VPN bandwidth will increase. If you are currently running on a 200mbps Internet connection and 50mbps VPN, consider increasing your VPN bandwidth to 100mbps to 150mbps since most of the activities will come from your remote users. If that is still not enough, increase your internet connection to 500mbps or 1gbps and add more bandwidth to VPN. Remember, the users will be utilizing the internet through your network while they are on VPN, so it is essential to make sure you have enough Internet bandwidth.</p><p>Note that there is a way to configure the VPN so that the user can access company resources through the VPN connection while navigating the internet through their internet provider. However, this is not recommended due to an increase in security risk.</p><h4>Cost of VPN</h4><p>Many companies may have purchased a bucket of concurrent licenses for VPN from a 3rd party vendor. Overnight, those licenses are depleted. You can buy more licenses to fulfill this need. However, consider how long the contract term is. You don’t want to be committed to a long-term contract while the need may only be temporary. Instead, consider using a VPN that comes with your firewall. Typically, there is no additional fee to use the VPN that comes with the firewall. </p><p>Companies, such as Fortinet and others, offer free VPN with the use of their equipment. Typically, the number of VPN connections will vary depending on the capacity of the individual hardware. For example, if you have the FortiGate 100F, you can have up to 200 VPN connections. Setting up VPN using your firewall is a great way to increase your VPN capacity.</p><p>If multifactor authentication is required, configure the VPN and connect to Microsoft AD. For Azure platform, enable multifactor authentication through MS Azure AD. When using AWS, enable multifactor authentication for your AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory.</p><h3>Team collaboration tool</h3><p>Allowing employees to work remotely will require you to have a practical collaboration tool. Microsoft Office 365 offers collaboration tool through MS Teams. MS Teams can be utilized for instant messaging, video conferencing, document sharing, and more. It is a great alternative to in-person collaboration. Other tools to consider include Slack, Trello, and Google (or any combination).</p><h3>Training and Communication</h3><p>Training is essential in order for team members learn how to use the tools for working remotely. A quick reference guide can be helpful in navigating these new changes. Additionally, set clear expectations for working remotely. Your employees need to understand what you need them to accomplish. At your organization, what will the expectations be for timeliness, deliverables, progress? Unless they understand the expectations for working remotely, you will not see the productivity you are hoping for.</p><h3>Doing things differently</h3><p>Finally, your organization must do things differently. With most of your employees working remotely, it is challenging to get everyone on the same page. You can’t just walk over to someone’s desk to discuss a problem. You can’t quickly gather people in a conference room for an urgent issue. Therefore, it is imperative to make sure you check in with your employees regularly. One way is to have a daily video conference to get your team on the same page. Employees must be easily reachable throughout the workday. Set the expectation that the team members are logged on to their collaboration tool. Employees should regularly connect with their team to execute their tasks. </p><p>We are all in this together.</p>",
      "summary": "COVID-19 has created an increase in demand for remote access. Suddenly, employees are being asked to work remotely. The demand for VPN connection can increase to 500% or more. Most small to mid-size companies may not have the infrastructure and tools to support this demand unless they are entirely on the cloud using SAAS based applications. ",
